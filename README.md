# [Food Insecurity in Low Income Tennessee Counties (2019)](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/6166a84d-342b-4d58-87bc-752ab8000fca/ReportSection)

## Overview
In this Capstone project my goal is to gain a bit of insight with a few questions:
- Of our communities, which areas may be struggling the most?
- What are some of the factors that might lead residents to face food insecurity?
- Is anything being done to help those that are struggling in these areas?

Join me in exploring a brief overview of this subject in our state.
